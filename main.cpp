/* The C++11 Concurrency Library introduces Atomic Types as a template class: std::atomic.
 * You can use any Type you want with that template and the operations on that variable will be atomic and so thread-safe.
 * It has to be taken into account that it is up to the library implementation
 * to choose which syncronization mechanism is used to make the operations on that type atomic.
 * On standard platforms for integral types like int, long, float, ... it will be some lock-free technique.
 * If you want to make a big type (let's saw 2MB storage), you can use std::atomic as well, but mutexes will be used.
 * In this case, there will be no performance advantage.
 * The main functions that std::atomic provide are the store and load functions that atomically set and get the contents of the std::atomic.
 * Another interesting function is exchange, that sets the atomic to a new value and returns the value held previously.
 * Finally, there are also two functions compare_exchange_weak and 
 * compare_exchance_strong that performs atomic exchange only if the value is equal to the provided expected value.
 * These two last functions can be used to implement lock-free algorithms.
 * std::atomic is specialized for all integral types to provide member functions specific to integral (like operators ++, --, fetch_add, fetch_sub, ...).
 * It is fairly easy to make the counter safe with std::atomic:
